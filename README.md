# SPIR-Registry
SPIR (Standard Portable Intermediate Representation) Registry.

This is the original SPIR for OpenCL, not the current SPIR-V,
which is found in https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/ .

This repository is used as a backing store for the web view of the registry at
https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR/ ; commits to the main branch of this
repository will be reflected there.

**NOTE**: as of 2021-08-09, the default branch of this repository has
been renamed from 'master' to 'main'.
